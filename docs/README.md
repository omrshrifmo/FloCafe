# FloCafe documentation index

This index classifies documentation in `docs/` so contributors and AI agents know which documents describe current runtime behavior, which describe planned designs, and which are historical records.

## Document authority

- **CURRENT**: Primary documentation for current supported behavior, setup, and developer workflows.
- **ACTIVE DESIGN**: Approved architecture currently being implemented. These describe target states that may be partially ahead of current code.
- **FORWARD-LOOKING**: Architecture proposals and plans that do not yet represent runtime contracts.
- **HISTORICAL**: Point-in-time audits, design records, or superseded specifications retained for context. Do not use these to drive new implementation unless an approved task or issue explicitly directs it.

> **Source of truth principle**: Current code and automated tests define what FloCafe does now. Approved task descriptions and GitHub issues define what a specific change is intended to accomplish. Cross-project invariants in `AGENTS.md` and `CURRENT` documentation govern broader constraints.

### Active design & forward-looking plans

| Document | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [tax-engine-v2-spec.md](tax-engine-v2-spec.md) | Architectural specification for Tax Engine v2, data-only country packs, and future capability plugin boundaries. *(Note: 2026-07-31 amendment establishes that country packs are catalog-only and not auto-bundled).* | ACTIVE DESIGN |
| [cloud-v2-plan.md](cloud-v2-plan.md) | Client integration plan for FloAdmin v2 cloud coordination. Phase 1 client work is implemented in code; forward-looking multi-device sync and FloAdmin contracts remain in design/specs. | ACTIVE DESIGN / FORWARD-LOOKING |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Core architecture overview, plugin system boundaries, and how runtime features stay isolated behind an enable/disable registry. | ACTIVE DESIGN |
| [regional-snapshot.md](regional-snapshot.md) | One backend `resolveRegionalSnapshot(settings)` resolver for country, currency symbol/position/fraction digits, locale separators, and business timezone, derived from the signup country/currency via `Intl`/ISO/IANA conventions with no default country and no per-store overrides; adopted by exactly two surfaces (server app, currency input/display) with contract tests per currency archetype. Prerequisite for the #693 reimplementation; supersedes PR #697. | ACTIVE DESIGN |
| [printing-nonlatin-capabilities.md](printing-nonlatin-capabilities.md) | Capability study and decision record for non-Latin scripts (Arabic/Persian, Hebrew, CJK, Indic) on ESC/POS hardware: approach comparison, Phase 9 capability-gated raster contract, community hardware-test matrix, and diagnostic test-page probe.
